creating the prediction model after analyzyng the data
 and finding out the reason for customers migrating to another telecom company.
implementing,Support Vector,Decision Tree,Logistic Regression and
Random Forest         
 The accuracy scores of all of them were calculated at the same time , within the single loop.The results cam out to be
 =>
Support Vector             0.8694083694083694
Decision Tree             0.8672438672438673
Logistic Regression             0.8672438672438673
Random Forest             0.9163059163059163

As randomForest gets the hieghest accuracy score, it is fine-tuned in the end , and  the trained model is exported as a file.
